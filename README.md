- 👋 Hi, I’m @alrod97, Alberto Rodriguez. I’m a Computer Vision and Deep Learning Engineer at Volkswagen AG in Munich.

### Research Interests
🔍 I focus on advancing Machine Learning, particularly in Computer Vision. My research includes Vision Transformers for semantic segmentation, as featured in my paper "Channel Wise Feature Augmentation (CWFA)," co-authored with NVIDIA. [Read here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01941).

### Computer Graphics
✨ I explore the intersection of Vision and Graphics, including WebGL experiments like pyramids and texture lighting.

### Applied Solutions
🚀 I’ve developed immersive XR applications using VisionOS and SwiftUI, including CUPRA’s Vision Pro app for 3D car visualizations.
