- 👋 Hi, I’m @alrod97, Alberto Rodriguez. I’m a Computer Vision and Deep Learning Engineer at Volkswagen AG in Munich.

### Research Interests
🔍 I focus on advancing Machine Learning, particularly in Computer Vision. My research includes Vision Transformers for semantic segmentation, as featured in my paper "Channel Wise Feature Augmentation (CWFA)," co-authored with NVIDIA. [Read here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01941). I started this collaboration during my Master Thesis in 2023, which led to the development of this work.

### Computer Graphics
✨ I explore the intersection of Vision and Graphics, including WebGL and OpenGL experiments. During my master’s studies, I focused on Computer Vision and Machine Learning/Deep Learning. While developing the Spatial Computing Solution at VW on Apple Vision Pro to visualize different CUPRA car models, my interest in Computer Graphics and real-time rendering was sparked, leading me to experiment extensively in 2024.

### Applied Solutions
🚀 I’ve developed immersive XR applications using VisionOS and SwiftUI, including CUPRA’s Vision Pro app for 3D car visualizations.
